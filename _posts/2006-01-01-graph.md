The `elsewhere.graph()` method accepts the following parameters:

**url** This is the URL that you wish to graph. The assumption is that it represents a person (or a company or organisation) and that the page at that URL has `rel=me` links to other URLs that also represent the person.

**options** (optional) This object contains properties used to configure the graph. The properties that can be passed in are: `strict`, `logLevel`, `crawlLimit`, `domainLimit`, `stripDeeperLinks`, `cacheTimeLimit` and `cacheItemLimit`.
These are the same options that can be set in the global configuration (see below).

**callback** (optional) This is a function to be called once the graph is ready. The callback is passed the completed graph as a `Graph` object.

The method returns a [promise][promise] object (created by the [Underscore.Deferred][_deferred] module). This is an alternative to using the `callback` parameter and provides fine-grained flow control.

Some examples of valid calls to the `graph()` method:

    var options = {strict:true},
    	callback = function(graph){
    		console.log(graph.toJSON());
    	};

    elsewhere.graph('http://premasagar.com', options, callback);

    elsewhere.graph('http://chrisnewtn.com', callback);

    elsewhere.graph('http://glennjones.net').then(callback);
