Node Social Graph requires [Node.js][node] that you will need to have installed before you can follow the instructions below. 

To download Node Social Graph and start the server, you just need run these commands in your terminal application.

    git clone git@github.com:dharmafly/node-socialgraph.git
    cd node-socialgraph
    npm install
    bin/node-socialgraph

Now just head to `localhost:8888`, type in a url and hit enter. The initial crawl will take while as each page needs to be visited and cached. Once cached though, you should find it pretty snappy.
