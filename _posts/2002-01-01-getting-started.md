Starting with {{ site.PROJECT_NAME }}
=====================

{{ site.PROJECT_NAME }} requires an up-to-date installation of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). 

To get started first clone the project into a new directory.

    git clone git@github.com:dharmafly/node-socialgraph.git

Then change into its directory and install its dependencies.

    cd node-socialgraph
    npm install

Finally, to run an example app that makes use of the graph run this from the project's root directory.

    bin/node-socialgraph
