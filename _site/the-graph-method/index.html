<p>The <code>graph</code> method takes the following three parameters.</p>

<p><strong>url</strong> This is the url that you wish to graph. The assumption is that it represents a person and has <code>rel=me</code> links to other urls also representing that person.</p>

<p><strong>options</strong> (optional) This object literal contains a few properties used to configure the graph. These properties are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>strict (boolean) <code>true</code> for strict mode, <code>false</code> otherwise. Strict mode only returns urls that link back to either the url provided in the first parameter or another url that does.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>crawlLimit (integer) The number of links Elsewhere will follow without a successful verification before it abandons the chain. Defaults to 3.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>stripDeeperLinks (boolean) If set to <code>true</code> then Elsewhere will discard links that share a domain with another link or links at a shallower level. E.g. plus.google.com/{id} is kept, while plus.google.com/{id}/posts is discarded.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>callback</strong> (optional) The function provided as this parameter will be called once the graph has been completely constructed. The callback is provided with one parameter: a completed <code>Graph</code> object.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of valid calls to the graph method.</p>

<pre><code>var options = {
  strict: true
}

var callback = function (graph) {};

elsewhere.graph(&#39;http://premasagar.com&#39;, options, callback);

elsewhere.graph(&#39;http://chrisnewtn.com&#39;, callback);

elsewhere.graph(&#39;http://glennjones.net&#39;).then(callback);</code></pre>
