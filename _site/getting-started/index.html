<p>Elsewhere requires <a href='http://nodejs.org/'>Node.js</a> that you will need to have installed before you can follow the instructions below.</p>

<p>To download Elsewhere and start the server, you just need run these commands in your terminal application.</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:dharmafly/elsewhere.git
cd elsewhere
npm install
bin/elsewhere</code></pre>

<p>Now just head to <code>localhost:8888</code>, type in a url and hit enter. The initial crawl will take while as each page needs to be visited and cached. Once cached though, you should find it pretty snappy.</p>
