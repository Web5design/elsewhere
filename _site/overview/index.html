<p>&#8291;<span class='project-name'>Elsewhere</span> is a Node.js project that aims to replicate the functionality of the Google Social Graph API.</p>

<p>It does this by crawling a target url for <code>rel=me</code> <a href='http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me'>microformated</a> links. It then crawls those links for more <code>rel=me</code> links and so on, building a comprehensive graph as it goes.</p>

<p>Elsewhere provides a JSON API that URL&#8217;s can be easily queried against via client JavaScript. It can also be included as a <a href='http://nodejs.org/'>Node.js</a> module and used directly in your server projects.</p>
